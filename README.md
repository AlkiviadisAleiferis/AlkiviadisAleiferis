Greetings! My name is Alkiviadis Aleiferis, and i'm from Greece.
Once i got into Python for good i knew i found my real native language
and my passion pussed me to my thesis on Python using many tools and libraries.
I may lack proffesional experience for now but my creativity is not depending
on that, and one can verify that browsing my upcoming projects.
My dream is to work in Data engineering, using the sharpest technologies avalable.
